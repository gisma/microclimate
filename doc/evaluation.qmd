# Evaluation of Atmosphere‚ÄìVegetation Interaction Models for operational use

Understanding microclimatic and ecological processes at high spatial resolution requires integrated modeling approaches that couple atmospheric dynamics with plant and vegetation processes. The models compared here span a wide range of capabilities, from fluid dynamics solvers to ecophysiological simulators. This document introduces the evaluation criteria, explains the scoring approach, and provides literature references for further exploration.

## Objective of the Evaluation

This model comparison aims to evaluate and categorize existing modeling platforms that simulate atmosphere-vegetation interactions, emphasizing realistic deployment, dimensional and structural detail, and biophysical relevance. While many models offer advanced features in isolation, such as turbulence modeling, vegetation physiology, or 3D structural input, only a few integrate these capabilities in a usable and accessible way. This evaluation considers not only modeling power but also technical complexity, scientific maturity, and practical deployability.

-   Full 3D support with high spatial resolution
-   Integration of real-world vegetation structure from TLS, QSM, or ALS
-   Explicit representation of plant‚Äìatmosphere feedback (e.g., transpiration effects on local climate)
-   Availability of user interfaces, documentation, licensing, and feasibility on common research workstations

## The Evaluation Framework

When selecting a suitable model for simulating interactions between the atmosphere and vegetation, more aspects than just scientific completeness must be taken into account in the context of operationalization. Models differ considerably in their structure, focus, technical maturity, and accessibility. What does this mean? Some models achieve excellent physical accuracy (e.g., LES-based turbulence and complete feedback between plants and the atmosphere) but require in-depth technical knowledge or high-performance computers. Other models, on the other hand, sacrifice physical completeness in favor of practicality and easy integration into planning or monitoring processes.

Our attempt is to enable this multi-criteria assessment and make it comprehensible by means of an evaluation framework in order to arrive at a pre-selection. This is done by combining quantitative assessments with a qualitative classification system, in particular:

-   scientific completeness based on various categories
-   operational usability

The evaluation is based on clearly defined criteria such as model physics, plant physiology, plant structure, model dimensionality and scales, and user-friendliness. However, the relative weights reflect value-based assessments ‚Äì what is considered more important depends on the context (urban planning vs. ecohydrology vs. forest micrometeorology). In concrete terms, this means:

-   In urban planning, user-friendliness and realistic 3D air flows may be paramount.

-   In plant science, biophysics and physiology may be paramount.

-   In forestry, compatibility with TLS or QSM inputs may be required.

This is not a weakness, but a strength, as it allows adaptation to the user's goals ‚Äì as long as the weighting and criteria are transparent.

### Integrated Criteria Table for Atmosphere‚ÄìVegetation Model Evaluation (Max Score = 10.0)
<div style="zoom: 0.6;">
| Criterion | Weight | Sub-Capabilities / Description | Scoring Guidelines |

</div>
### The flags "microscale applicable" and "experimental or outdated"

Microscale applicable models can resolve processes on spatial scales of ‚â§ 10 m. At this scale, air flows, radiation, and microclimate dynamics become relevant at the tree level. These models are typically characterized by the following features:

-   They work with high-resolution 3D grids.
-   Vegetation is explicitly represented (e.g., voxel- or TLS-based).
-   Localized simulations of plots, tree groups, or urban areas are possible.

Microscale capability is essential for LiDAR-based modeling, urban forestry, and the investigation of microclimates in tree canopies.
<div style="zoom: 0.6;">
| Symbol | Microscale Capability Description |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ | **Fully applicable**: Designed for a resolution of ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚ÄØm with 3D vegetation‚Äìatmosphere coupling. |
| üü® | **Conditionally applicable**: Partial support for high resolutions, but limited physics or geometry. |
| ‚ùå | **Not applicable**: Coarse resolution or missing spatial details. |
</div>
The following characteristics are flagged with an ‚ùå  for experimental or obsolete models:

- no longer maintained or widely used.
- they were developed for niche applications or obsolete use cases.
- there is a complete lack of user-friendly workflows or adequate documentation.

This leads to the following classification scheme:
<div style="zoom: 0.6;">
| Flag | Label | Implied<br> Score | Explanation¬†of¬†the¬†Classification |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| üü© | High capability, high usability | 7.0‚Äì10.0 | Fully featured and deployable with reasonable effort (GUI, docs, user base) |
| üüß | High capability, low usability | 7.0‚Äì10.0 | Powerful but difficult to use; expert-only setup, low maturity |
| üü¶ | Moderate capability, well-integrated | 5.0‚Äì6.9 | Solid for many tasks; lacks advanced coupling but usable and balanced |
| üü® | Specialized model, high usability | 4.0‚Äì6.9 | Limited scope (e.g. radiation only), but very accessible and documented |
| üü• | Experimental or niche | 4.0‚Äì6.9 | Limited audience or non-generalizable application |
| ‚ùå | Legacy/unmaintained/ not usable | any | No active development or practical use case today |
</div>


**Note:** This classification does not always correspond to the ranking by score, which is intentional. For example, a model with a high score may still be marked with üüß or ‚ùå if it is technically difficult to implement, is not documented or maintained, or is simply no longer available. This helps to put the pure scoring performance into perspective, which would otherwise lead to the selection of models that prove to be unusable in practice.


## Atmosphere‚ÄìVegetation Model Comparison of Models

Fifteen models were systematically evaluated based on the assessment framework presented above. The models were selected on an exploratory basis using Google searches, specialist literature (e.g., GMD Geoscientific Model Development, ScienceDirect), well-known model comparisons, and open-source repositories. The selection is therefore well-founded but not entirely systematic. The following tables shows the results of this evaluation. It not only shows the weighted overall score, but also differentiates between the underlying individual criteria. In addition, the applicability in the microscale range is indicated and each model is classified using a color-coded classification system. This makes the performance of a model in terms of the atmosphere-vegetation coupling transparent and shows the extent to which a model can be realistically integrated into scientific or operational processes.\

Based on the upper table, the below graph helps visualize the trade-off between model capability and usability, making the multi-dimensional classification system intuitively accessible at a glance.

![Model usability vs. total score across classified microclimate models. The inverse relationship reflects a common trade-off: high-performing models (right) often require expert-level setup (low usability, bottom), while user-friendly models (top) tend to be simplified. Colored points reflect model classification: üü© usable and capable, üüß powerful but complex, üü¶ balanced, üü® specialized, and üü• experimental. Models above the trend line (e.g., ENVI-met) offer better usability than expected for their score; those below (e.g., MuSICA) require disproportionately high effort.](score.png)

### Final Selection of Models

If we narrow the selection by removing models that are either **classified as legacy systems (‚ùå )** or that **lack both microscale applicability (‚ùå) and fully resolved 3D spatial representation (\<1.0)**, the set of viable modeling platforms is drastically reduced. This filtering excludes tools that are either outdated, lack dimensional realism, or are designed for coarse-scale applications incompatible with high-resolution vegetation‚Äìatmosphere modeling. What remains is a focused set of platforms that combine **scientific robustness** with **operational feasibility** for modeling processes at the tree or plot level. These remaining models offer realistic support for implementation in **urban microclimate design**, **LiDAR-informed ecological studies**, and **vegetation-based climate adaptation strategies** where 3D feedbacks and spatial structure matter.
