Purpose of Tree Data for ENVI-met Modeling
This workflow prepares classified tree species data as a basis for generating individual tree objects for use in ENVI-met’s 3DPLANT module. Each tree location is linked to a simplified vertical LAD profile and assigned to a species class (e.g. Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, Pseudotsuga menziesii), which defines its interaction with ENVI-met’s radiation and vegetation modules.

The underlying classification raster originates from official, state-level aerial RGB orthophotos with a spatial resolution of 0.3 m. These orthophotos provide sufficient detail to allow object-based species classification at the level of individual tree crowns.

Species prediction was performed using a leave-location-out forward feature selection approach implemented via the CAST package in R. This ensures that classification results generalize across spatially distinct regions by avoiding overfitting to local spectral conditions.

Before assigning vegetation objects to the ENVI-met model domain, species maps are despeckled, aggregated, and contextually corrected to remove isolated or misclassified tree crowns (e.g. Douglas-fir pixels in beech-dominated stands). This ensures that each synthetic ENVI-met tree is placed in a semantically and structurally consistent vegetation context.



## 1. Setup and Environment

Manual Setup of OTB Environment for use with link2GI

The R package `link2GI` provides wrapper functions to connect R with external geospatial software like Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), GRASS GIS, and QGIS. The function `linkOTB()` is used to locate OTB binaries and configure the R session to allow calling OTB applications via command-line interface (CLI) from R.

However, in many modern setups—especially on Linux or in manually installed environments (e.g., extracted zip files)—the required environment variables are not set globally, and `linkOTB()` alone is not sufficient. This typically leads to errors like:

* "Application not found"
* "No XML application descriptors"
* "Could not find CLI tools"

To fix this, two critical environment variables need to be explicitly set after calling `linkOTB()`:

1. `OTB_APPLICATION_PATH`:
   This must point to the directory `lib/otb/applications`, where all XML definitions of the OTB applications are stored. These XML files describe how to call each OTB tool from the command line.

2. `PATH`:
   This must include the directory where OTB binaries like `otbcli_BandMath` are stored (typically `bin/`). Without this, system calls from R to OTB will fail.

Example for Linux:

```r
otb <- link2GI::linkOTB(searchLocation = "~/apps/OTB-9.1.0-Linux/")
Sys.setenv(OTB_APPLICATION_PATH = file.path(dirname(as.character(otb$pathOTB)), "lib/otb/applications"))
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(otb$pathOTB, Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep = ":"))
```

Example for Windows:

```r
otb <- link2GI::linkOTB(searchLocation = "C:/OTB-9.1.0-Win64/")
Sys.setenv(OTB_APPLICATION_PATH = "C:/OTB-9.1.0-Win64/lib/otb/applications")
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("C:/OTB-9.1.0-Win64/bin", Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep = ";"))
```

Note:

* On Windows, use forward slashes `/` in the path.
* The PATH separator is `;` on Windows and `:` on Unix-based systems.

This workaround is often necessary in portable, containerized, or research setups where full system integration (e.g., PATH exports, registry entries) is not available or not desired. It ensures that `link2GI` can still function as intended by emulating the expected environment internally within R.


```{r env-setup}

# Load libraries
library(terra)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(link2GI)
library(envimaR)
library(tools)
library(mapview)
library(dplyr)

# Project root and OTB environment
root_folder <- rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()
otb <- link2GI::linkOTB(searchLocation = "~/apps/OTB-9.1.0-Linux/")
Sys.setenv(OTB_APPLICATION_PATH = file.path(dirname(as.character(otb$pathOTB)), "lib/otb/applications"))
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(otb$pathOTB, Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep = ":"))
```

## 2. Parameters and Class Legend

```{r parameters}
target_res <- 1
fn <- "5-25_MOF_rgb"
epsg <- 25832
sapflow_ext <- raster::extent(477500, 478218, 5631730, 5632500)

ts <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:12,
  value = c("agriculture", "alder", "ash", "beech", "douglas_fir", "larch",
            "oak", "pastures", "roads", "settlements", "spruce", "water")
)
```

## 3. Rationale: Why Despeckle First?

> **🔍 Why do we despeckle at original resolution before aggregation and contextual filtering?**
>
> - **Preserve spatial detail**: High-frequency noise (e.g., misclassified single pixels) must be removed *before* they get averaged into larger grid cells.
> - **Avoid error propagation**: Aggregating first would carry speckle artifacts into the coarser grid.
> - **Enable ecologically meaningful correction**: Focal filtering (e.g., Douglas-fir to Oak) should be applied on ~1 m resolution where "dominance" of classes has meaning.
> - **Step order summary**:
>     1. `ClassificationMapRegularization`: Clean noise at 0.2 m
>     2. `aggregate()`: Smooth to 1 m (e.g., crown scale)
>     3. `focal()`: Replace ecologically implausible patches

## 4. Load and Preprocess Species Classification

```{r read-classification}
sapflow_species <- readRDS("data/aerial/sfprediction_ffs_5-25_MOF_rgb.rds")
raster::writeRaster(sapflow_species, "data/aerial/prediction_ffs.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
sapflow_species <- raster::crop(sapflow_species, sapflow_ext)
raster::writeRaster(sapflow_species, "data/aerial/prediction_ffs_cut.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
```

## 5. Majority Filtering (OTB Despeckle)

```{r otb-majority}
cmr <- parseOTBFunction("ClassificationMapRegularization", otb)
cmr$io.in <- "data/aerial/prediction_ffs.tif"
cmr$io.out <- "data/aerial/majority_out.tif"
cmr$ip.radius <- "1"
cmr$progress <- "true"
filter_treespecies <- runOTB(cmr, gili = otb$pathOTB, quiet = FALSE, retRaster = TRUE)
```

## 6. Aggregate to 1 m Resolution

```{r aggregate}
r <- rast("data/aerial/majority_out.tif")
cur_res <- res(r)[1]
fact <- round(target_res / cur_res)
if (target_res <= cur_res) stop("Target resolution is lower than input resolution.")
r_agg <- aggregate(r, fact = fact, fun = median, na.rm = TRUE)
outfile <- sprintf("data/aerial/%s_%sm.tif", tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename("data/aerial/aggregate.tif")), target_res)
writeRaster(r_agg, outfile, overwrite = TRUE)
```

## 7. Contextual Correction (Douglas → Beech/Oak)

```{r contextual-replace}
replace_douglas_in_buche_eiche <- function(rast_input,
                                           window_size = 5,
                                           douglas_value = 5,
                                           target_values = c(4, 7),
                                           target_res = 1.0) {
  if (!inherits(rast_input, "SpatRaster")) stop("Input must be SpatRaster")
  if (window_size %% 2 == 0) stop("window_size must be odd")
  w <- matrix(1, nrow = window_size, ncol = window_size)
  r_mode <- focal(rast_input, w = w, fun = modal, na.policy = "omit", na.rm = TRUE, progress = "text")
  is_douglas <- rast_input == douglas_value
  is_oak_beech_mode <- r_mode %in% target_values
  replace_mask <- is_douglas & is_oak_beech_mode
  r_new <- rast_input
  r_new[replace_mask] <- r_mode[replace_mask]
  writeRaster(r_new, sprintf("data/aerial/%s_%sm.tif", "agg_cleand", target_res), overwrite = TRUE)
  return(r_new)
}
species_cleaned <- replace_douglas_in_buche_eiche(r_agg, window_size = 5)
```

## 8. Visualize Results

```{r visualize, eval=interactive()}
mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)
m1 <- mapview(filter_treespecies, col.regions = brewer.pal(12, "Paired"), at = ts$ID)
m2 <- mapview(species_cleaned, col.regions = brewer.pal(12, "Paired"), at = ts$ID)
m1 + m2
