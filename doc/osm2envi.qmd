# Overview

The `OSM2Envi_met` QGIS Processing tool provides a fully automated workflow for preparing spatial input data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and elevation datasets for use in ENVI-met 3D simulations. It combines a Python-based QGIS interface with a shell script that performs a robust geospatial preprocessing pipeline via `qgis_process`, `gdal`, and `ogr2ogr`.

This document describes how to install the tool, explains the internal processing workflow, and provides a link to the complete codebase.

# Installation

## Requirements

To run this tool successfully, you need:

- QGIS 3.28+ with `qgis_process` installed and accessible from the command line
- GDAL with `ogr2ogr` and `gdal_calc.py`
- A Bash shell (macOS/Linux, or Git Bash on Windows)

## Setup Steps

1. Download the tool:

   - From GitHub as ZIP:  
     https://github.com/gisma/qgis-processing-workflows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

   - Or clone via Git:
     git clone https://github.com/gisma/qgis-processing-workflows.git

2. Copy the relevant scripts to your QGIS processing script directory:

   ~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/processing/scripts/
   â”œâ”€â”€ osm2envi_qgis.sh       # Main processing Bash script
   â””â”€â”€ osm2envi_tool.py       # QGIS Processing tool wrapper

3. Make the Bash script executable:

   chmod +x osm2envi_qgis.sh

4. Restart QGIS.  
   The tool will now appear under:
   Processing Toolbox â†’ Envi_met Tools â†’ OSM2Envi_met

# Parameters

Parameter     | Type              | Required | Description
--------------|-------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------
OSM           | File              | Yes      | Path to input `.osm` file
DEM           | File              | No       | DEM raster, required if DSM is used
DSM           | File              | No       | DSM raster, required if DEM is used
CRS           | Coordinate system | Yes      | Target projection (e.g., EPSG:25832)
EXTENT        | Bounding box      | Yes      | Spatial extent to clip data
LOAD_LAYERS   | Boolean           | No       | Load output into QGIS after processing

# Workflow Description

The internal script performs the following geospatial operations:

## 1. OSM Conversion

- Converts the `.osm` file into a multi-layered GeoPackage using `ogr2ogr`.

## 2. Feature Extraction

- Extracts thematic layers from `multipolygons` or `lines` using SQL expressions:
  - Vegetation: landuse like `forest`, `meadow`, `orchard`, etc.
  - Surfaces: roads and natural surfaces from `highway` and `landuse`
  - Buildings: all OSM geometries tagged as `building`

- Each layer is:
  - Reprojected into the target CRS using `qgis_process`
  - Clipped to the specified extent

## 3. Classification (ENVIMET ID)

- Assigns an `ENVIMET_ID` attribute based on feature type:
  - Forest â†’ 0000SM
  - Asphalt â†’ 0200AK
  - Industrial landuse â†’ 0200AK
  - Wetland â†’ 0200LI

- Classification is done using SQL CASE statements in `qgis_process:fieldcalculator`.

## 4. Height Extraction (optional)

If both DSM and DEM are provided:

- Calculates a difference raster (DSM âˆ’ DEM) using `gdal_calc.py`
- Computes mean building heights (`height_mean`) via zonal statistics
- Adds height attribute to the building layer

If no elevation data is provided, this step is skipped.

## 5. Road Buffering

- Buffers road geometries based on `highway` type:
  - Primary: 10 m, Secondary: 6 m, Tertiary: 4 m, Track: 1 m

- Buffers are classified like surfaces and merged later.

## 6. Layer Merging

- Merges:
  - Buffered roads
  - Surface landuse polygons

- Creates a unified surface layer for ENVIMET (`*_surface_final.gpkg`)

## 7. Cleanup

- Deletes all intermediate files:
  - `_tmp.gpkg`, `_proj.gpkg`, `_clip.gpkg`

- Keeps only the final classified and merged output layers

## 8. Optimization for ENVI-met

- Retains only necessary fields:
  - Geometry
  - `ENVIMET_ID`
  - `height_mean` (if computed)

- Saves final layers as:
  - `*_surface_final_envimet.gpkg`
  - `*_vegetation_final_envimet.gpkg`
  - `*_buildings_final_envimet.gpkg`

# Output Files

Filename                            | Content
------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
*_surface_final_envimet.gpkg        | Merged surface classes (landuse + roads)
*_vegetation_final_envimet.gpkg     | Vegetation polygons with `ENVIMET_ID`
*_buildings_final_envimet.gpkg      | Buildings, optionally with `height_mean`
qgis_<area>.log                     | Processing log with detailed diagnostics

---

# Logging and Error Handling

- All shell output is streamed into the QGIS console.
- Colored Bash output is stripped for readability.
- Full logs are written to:

  /path/to/output/qgis_<research_area>.log

- If a required input is missing or a step fails, the script aborts and QGIS reports the issue via `feedback.reportError()`.

# Summary

This tool provides a robust, reproducible, and spatially-aware way to prepare `.osm` files for ENVI-met 3DPLANT and surface modeling. By combining QGIS processing, GDAL utilities, and Bash automation, it minimizes manual preprocessing and produces clean, simulation-ready outputs for urban climate studies.
